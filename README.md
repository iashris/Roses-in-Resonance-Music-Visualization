# Roses in Resonance Music Visualization
This project is a Processing visualization of music using FFT Spectrum Analysis.

## Setup
The project works for both Processing 2 and 3. Please ensure you have the [Ess](http://www.tree-axis.com/Ess/) library installed. Place the .wav file (named 'beethoven-5th.wav' in example) in the data folder.

## Future Goals
[12th october 2016] I plan to make a web app for enabling live visualization using p5js. I however will need to find for a replacement to the Ess library. 

## p5js demo
